# help_me_decide

A app that let's you make decisions quickly (although depends on chance).

## Getting Started
Help Me Decide would help you make quick decisions when you are in a fix. 
All you have to do is think of a question in mind and tap on the app screen and 
boom you have an answer (although this is random answer and thus beware).
You don't want to decide whether you want to save this world or not based on this.
